Device connection
=====================

Ensure that the sub-device to connect has been registered to EnOS Cloud.
Ensure that the topological relationship with the edge has been added to
the edge. EnOS Cloud verifies the identity of the sub-device according
to the topological relationship to identify whether the sub-device can
use the edge connection.
