# Reporting Attributes, Measure points and Events to EnOS (Non-DTLS)

Devices connected to EnOS through CoAP can report attribute values, measure points, and events to EnOS. The process is as follows:

.. image:: ../../../media/coap_upstream_flow_non_dtls.png

The data transmitted by the low-power devices connected via CoAP are often binary. These data can be passed through to EnOS and then converted to EnOS-defined JSON by using the parsing script.

When a device is connected to EnOS via CoAP, the topic and parameter specifications are consistent with those of MQTT. For more information about the request data formats, response data formats and parameter descriptions for upstream messages, see [Reporting Attributes, Measurepoints and Events from Devices (Pass-through)](../../mqtt/upstream/device_else/report_event_pass) and [Report Device Eventsâ€‹ (Non-Passthrough)](../../mqtt/upstream/device_else/report_event_nopass).

The data reported by the device is in the following format:

```json
POST /topic/sys/${ProductKey}/${DeviceKey}/thing/model/up_raw
Payload: ${Payload}
```
In the previous message:

.. csv-table::
    :widths: auto

    "Parameter", "Description"
    "ProductKey", "Used for authentication"
    "DeviceKey", "Used for authentication"
    "Payload", "The data that is reported to EnOS"

The response EnOS sends to the device includes the payload requested as well as the CoAP return code. The format of the response is as follows:

```json
Code: CoAP return code
Payload: {Payload}
```
