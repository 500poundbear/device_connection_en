# Reporting Attributes, Measure points and Events to EnOS (Non-DTLS)

Devices connected to EnOS through CoAP can report attribute values, measure points, and events to EnOS. The process is as follows:

.. image:: ../../../media/coap_upstream_flow_non_dtls.png

The data transmitted by the low-power devices connected via CoAP are often binary. These data can be passed through to EnOS and then converted to EnOS-defined JSON by using the parsing script.

When a device is connected to EnOS via CoAP, the topic and parameter specifications are consistent with those of MQTT. For more information about the request data formats, response data formats and parameter descriptions for upstream messages, see [Reporting Attributes, Measurepoints and Events from Devices (Pass-through)](../../mqtt/upstream/device_else/report_event_pass).

The data reported by the device is in the following format:

```json
POST /topic/sys/${ProductKey}/${DeviceKey}/thing/model/up_raw
Payload: ${Payload}
Customized Option 2101 : ${Sign}
```
In the previous message:

.. csv-table::
    :widths: auto

    "Parameter", "Description"
    "ProductKey", "Used for authentication"
    "DeviceKey", "Used for authentication"
    "Payload", "The data that is reported to EnOS"
    "Sign", "Digital signature used for authentication"

.. note:: `${Sign}` is generated in the following procedure:
 1. Concatenate the following fields in the following order:` token${Token}sequence${Sequence}`
     `${Token}` is the token assigned to the device when it is authenticated by EnOS. `${Sequence}` is positive int which indicates the order of messages a device sends to EnOS in a session. The first message in a session has a sequence value of 1. `${Sequence}` must be larger than the sequence of the last message the device sent to EnOS. If the device loses the sequence of the last message it sends to EnOS, it must re-initiate authentication.

 2. Generate `${SignKey}` by extracting Byte 9 to Byte 24 from the SHA-256 hash of `${DeviceSecret}`. The lenght of `${SignKey}` is 16 bytes.

 3. Calculate the AES-128 hash of `${SignKey}` and `token${Token}sequence${Sequence}`

 4. Capitalize the letters in the calculated hash.

The response EnOS sends to the device includes the payload requested as well as the CoAP return code. The format of the response is as follows:

```json
Code: CoAP return code
Payload: {Payload}
```
