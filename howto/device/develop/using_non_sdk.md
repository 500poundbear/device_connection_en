# Not Using SDK

When the device SDKs provided by EnOS cannot meet your requirements, you can send telemetries into EnOS Cloud based on the EnOS device protocol standards, which defines the data format of the MQTT-based transmission between devices and EnOS cloud. You can connect your devices into EnOS as long as your data format conforms to the standard.

- If the devices use the MQTT protocol to communicate with EnOS cloud, see [Device Protocol for MQTT](../../../reference/mqtt/index).
- If the devices are using the CoAP protocol to communicate with EnOS cloud, see [Device Protocol for CoAP](../../../reference/coap/index).
