# Getting started with direct device connection
For devices that support MQTT protocols, you can connect the devices into EnOS directly with the following major steps.

## Step 1: Create sites and devices

Use the **Sites and Devices** function to create sites and associate devices into your sites.

## Step 2: Organize sites

Use the **Asset Management** function to arrange your sites hierachically according to their organization in the real world.

## Step 3: Create templates that adapts device models to real devices
Device templates, which play as the adaptor between device models and real devices, mainly define the communication protocol and mapping relationship between the data acquisition point and device model point.

Use the **Templates** function to create templates for your devices.

## Step 4: Configure the device connection

Use the **Device Connection** function to define the connnection parameters for the your devices.
