# Managing Devices

This article describes the management operations such as how to view and change device status, how to obtain device secret credentials, and more.

## Before You Start

To learn about the activation and running status of a device, please refer to [Secret-based One-way Authentication](../secretbased_authentication).

## Viewing Activation Status

1. In the control panel, select **Access Management > Device Management**.
2. You can view the device status on the page. The "Inactive" status is displayed only when the product is not activated.

Once the product is activated, its running status - online or offline - will be displayed in the console.

## Device Going Online/Offline

When a device is in operation, you can change its status by turning it on or off.

If the device is found to be abnormal, it can be disabled in EnOS.
1. In the control panel, select **Access Management > Device Management**.
2. Go to the **Status/Enable** column to disable the device.
